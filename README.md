## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Upload the Files to a Hosting Provider

You can use:
- **GitHub Pages** (recommended)
- **Netlify** or **Vercel**
- **Firebase Hosting**
- Any static hosting service

Ensure that all files—including `index.html`, `firebase-init.js`, and CSS/JS—are at the **root level** of your hosting directory.

---

### 2. That’s It — It Just Works™

This build:
- ✅ Automatically connects to the embedded Firebase project
- ✅ No longer requires any setup or form input
- ✅ Is mobile-friendly and compatible across browsers

New users will land directly on the login screen and can sign up or log in right away.

### 🔁 Want to Reuse This for Another Client?

To convert this app into a **reusable template**:
1. Ask your client to build and open their own Firebase and copy the Firebase Config File.
2. Remove the hardcoded Firebase object from the current `firebase-init.js` and change the Firebase config into their own.
3. Add back the setup flow logic for custom project embedding

Need help preparing a configurable version? Let me know—I can package that for you.
